## VU Career Days (VU KD)

![VU KD](</img/logos/Karjeros Dienos.png>){width=250}

<!-- SECTION:kd1:START -->

*Manager – Agnė Dirmantaitė*

Vilnius University Career Days (VU KD) is the largest project of VU SR, which has been running for 20 years. 

The project aims to help students meet potential employers, make new connections and start their career path on their own. The project aims to help students get a job in the labour market and become marketable professionals in their field.  

<!-- SECTION:kd1:END -->
<!-- SECTION:kd2:START -->

In its anniversary year, the project invited participants to participate in various events and discuss topical issues (job search for international students, the use of artificial intelligence in the professional space, and career transition). This year, CV and LinkedIn workshops were organised for students from Šiauliai and Kaunas faculties.   

From the 7th to the 11th of April, the week's main events took place, turning the Saulėtekis into a real career search centre. More than 80 companies and organisations participated in the two-day Contact Fair, and about 7000 students from different faculties interacted with them. More than 60 Quick Job Interviews took place, where participants could try their hand at job interview simulations. 8 teams took part in the 24-hour hackathon, organised in partnership with SEB Bank, 3 of which shared a prize fund of 1000 EUR to develop their ideas. The week ended at the LOFTAS Art Factory, where more than 500 young people enjoyed a free concert. 

<!-- SECTION:kd2:END -->

## VU Debate Club (VU DS)

![VU KD](</img/logos/Debatu Klubas.png>){width=250}

<!-- SECTION:debatuklubas1:START -->

*Manager – Paulina Šalkauskaitė*

VU Debate Club (VUDS) - a club founded in 2004 to promote communication between students from different faculties, to provide a space for the development of critical thinking, argumentation, English language and public speaking skills, and to represent Vilnius University in debate tournaments. 

<!-- SECTION:debatuklubas1:END -->
<!-- SECTION:debatuklubas2:START -->

VUDS has had an incredibly great period of growth during this year both hosting events and participating in international tournaments (notably, ones in Ryga, Reims, Stockholm and so on).  

This year, we managed to host 2 incredible tournaments both at a local and international scale. In late March, we organized and hosted the Vilnius Speakeasy tournament aimed at empowering Lithuanian British Parliamentary (BP) style debaters which enthralled its participants with a jazzy, 1920’s theme. In early May, however, we managed to put something together that we are really proud of - the largest BP tournament in Lithuania (as of recent years) with an international organization team bearing our universities name with a participation of over 40 teams (meaning 80 active debaters, all of which have practiced their craft for months).  

Apart from these great achievements, we’re also proud to say that we’ve increased our active club members to around 40 people (most it has ever been!) and have been hosting sessions twice a week, before which there are quality workshops by our training officer. Debaters not only get to improve by practicing their craft, but learning how to make and structure arguments, learning the basics of topics such as politics, economics, ethics, technology and law. This combined knowledge has resulted in our debaters increasing their public speaking, English language, organization, confidence and teamwork skills.  

By organizing weekly meetings, we ensure the strengthening of our society for years to come, preparing handover documents to the next council and staying on our toes for upcoming opportunities to organize something exciting.  

Furthermore, looking at our success through attracting members through social media, we plan on furthering our reach next year with the same technique, continuing our legacy.

*Manager - Lėja Ažukaitė*

<!-- SECTION:esn1:START -->

ESN Vilnius University is a VU SR programme that promotes student mobility and helps international students successfully integrate into the VU community. 

<!-- SECTION:esn1:END -->
<!-- SECTION:esn2:START -->

The main goal is to help the incoming exchange students adapt to the new environment, introduce them to Lithuanian culture and traditions, answer any questions they may have, and promote local students' internationality. This year, ESN Vilnius University has been very active locally and internationally. More than 115 events were organised for the whole Vilnius University community. These engaging events encouraged a deeper understanding of Lithuanian culture - its customs, language, cuisine and festivals - and contributed to promoting intercultural dialogue. They have significantly impacted the local community, promoting openness, empathy and solidarity between people of different cultures. These initiatives have made international students feel welcome and valued while broadening the horizons of local students and raising international awareness. This created strong, long-lasting links between students from different countries worldwide and strengthened the image of Vilnius University as an open, multicultural community. 

The "ESNbuddy" programme also attracted much attention, as exchange students could meet mentors - volunteers who helped them find their way in a new environment, answered all their questions, and often became good friends. The EU project "Equal Voices: Gender Camp and School Action" was also a success, winning first prize in the international social impact category of the ESN Awards. The project aimed to bring together local and international students to promote gender equality awareness in Lithuanian schools by fostering cooperation, sharing experiences and creating lasting values. It also represented the university and the organisation internationally, participating in major conferences such as the Erasmus Generation Meeting Ancona 2025, the largest student-organised conference in Europe, and the Northern European Platform Tallinn 2024. Thanks to the volunteers' sincere work and dedication, we received warm feedback from the international students, who thanked us for the opportunity to make friends, get to know Lithuania differently and feel part of the Vilnius University community.

*Manager – Gytis Oškelis*

The mission of the Student Civil Resistance Committee (SCRC) is to educate students about civil resistance and to increase their will to defend themselves. SCRC is a young initiative, officially established in April 2024.

<!-- SECTION:sppk2:START -->

12 events have been organised in 12 months. Discussions and lectures explored national defence issues from different perspectives: visits to sites where students resisted during the 1941 uprising, three general assemblies teaching tactical medicine, and the history and structure of the Lithuanian army. In addition, survival training was organised to improve practical survival skills.  

Committee members actively contributed to the drafting of the "Resolution on the Role of VU in Developing Community Resilience and Awareness of National Security Threats" and made proposals to make citizenship/resilience education a priority in the VU SA Strategic Plan.  

SCRC has more than twenty active members and > 520 Facebook and ≈ 300 Instagram followers on social networks.  The committee welcomes VU SR and all those who find their activities meaningful. It is hoped that in the next reporting year, as VU SR focuses even more on SCRC-themed activities, together they will create an even greater change in the development of resilience, awareness and civic resistance skills in the VU community.

## Consulting 

*Manager – Kamilė Valvonytė*

VU SR Counselling joined the VU SA PCP network in 2025. The aim of the VU SR Counselling process is to help the student to solve any problems that may arise, or to guide him/her to where others can help.   

VU SR counselling covers a wide range of issues, from admission to VU to complaints about study programmes, scholarships and joining VU SR activities. Advice is also available on dormitories, LSP and other issues relevant to students.  

From 2024 onwards, all counsellors will have to pass an academic and social knowledge test to ensure quality, accurate and responsible assistance. Advisers who pass the test contribute to the provision of consistent information throughout the organisation.    

The VU SR counselling team actively shared their knowledge and experience in internal VU SR faculty trainings as well as in faculty and global meetings.  

VU SR consultancy is more than just answering questions. It is a space that strives to build a supportive, informed and strong university community.
