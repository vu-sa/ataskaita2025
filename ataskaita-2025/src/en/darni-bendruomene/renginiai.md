# Community events

## September 1st VU parade 

This year, the main streets of Vilnius were swept by the 30th anniversary of the September 1st parade. Students, lecturers and other members of the Vilnius University community were partaking. We are pleased with the active, noisy and expressive participation of the students and the support of VU SR members during the procession. 

## Unit days 

Some of the biggest events organised by VU SR are the Unit Days, which have become an important and beautiful tradition that encourages communitarianism and the preservation of student traditions. This year, the nine Unit Days offered students a series of events, ranging from meaningful debates, sports games to the funniest dances.
