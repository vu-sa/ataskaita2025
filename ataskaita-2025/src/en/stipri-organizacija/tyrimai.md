## Integration analysis

The aim of the study is to assess the success of the integration of
first-year students into Vilnius University and to identify areas for
improvement in order to enhance the academic, social and cultural
experience of newly enrolled students.

What was studied: the success of the integration of first year BA and MA
students (both local and international) into the University.

The study was conducted: from 2 October 2024 to 1 November 2024.

Key findings of the report:

Over the last three years, student involvement in integration events has
increased, especially among undergraduate students, whose schedules are
more open to attend events. In contrast, Masters students are less
likely to attend, due to their higher availability and the less tailored
nature of the events. While Renovatio Studiorum remains the most popular
event and the Unit\'s event attendance is growing, other centres are
limited by lack of information and logistical constraints.

The most common learning difficulties encountered by students relate to
time management, organisation and memorising information. Another common
problem is the confusing university structure and incomprehensible
rules. Most solve these problems independently or rely on the help of
their fellow students, while official help - although appreciated - is
often unavailable due to limited communication.

Although students value the atmosphere of their courses and feel part of
micro-communities, the overall connection with the university community
remains weak. Information on study management, leisure time and
individual opportunities is still lacking, especially for first-year
students. Improved communication and strengthening of formal links
between aid and the community are needed to promote engagement and
improve the experience.

## Study on academic ethics 

**The aim of the study** is to identify the most common types and extent
of academic dishonesty at Vilnius University.

**What was investigated:** the extent of academic dishonesty at Vilnius
University, the different types of academic misconduct and the frequency
of fraud.

The study was carried out: from 10 December 2024 to 10 January 2025.

**Key findings of the report:**

Prevalence of academic dishonesty. 80% of students have engaged in
activities that could be considered academically dishonest at least once
in the last year. This shows the extent of the problem.

The impact of technology. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools
such as ChatGPT, Copilot or Quillbot is becoming more and more
widespread, with as many as 55.9% of students having used them for
academic purposes, and 14.54% having done so on a regular basis (11
times or more).

Unclear rules on the use of IoT. As many as 24.44% of students indicated
that they were not clear about the rules for using IoT at university,
while 11.40% said they were simply not aware of them.

Consideration of plagiarism. 35.97% of students paraphrased or copied
content without reference at least once, indicating a lack of focus on
citation and academic literacy.

Use of unauthorized sources. 35.77% of students used non-academic
sources such as Wikipedia or YouTube at least once for academic work
without proper critical analysis.

Submission of other people\'s work. 1.37% of students have submitted
work done by others at least once as their own. Although the number is
small, this is still a cause for concern.

## VU SA Community Survey 

The aim of the survey is to assess the involvement of the members of the
Organisation in the activities of VU SR and to find out the reasons for
their (dis)involvement.

What was studied: engagement of VU SR 2024-2025 term members in the
organisation\'s activities, strategic goals and internal communication
assessment.

The study was carried out: from 18 November 2024 to 1 December 2024.

**Key findings of the report:**

- Engagement of VU SR members. The overall engagement of VU SR members
  is 70%, while the engagement of members in leadership positions is
  75%. The most engaged (78%) are VU SR members who have been in the
  Organisation for four or more years.
- Development of general competences. A large number of VU SR members
  identified that they develop general competences through their
  activities in the Students\' Representation. The need to focus more on
  the development of intercultural competences was noted. In response to
  this need, we have included the topic of interculturality in the
  spring training of VU SA members.
- Development of other competences. In addition to general competences,
  VU SR members have identified that in the Students' Representation
  activities they develop managerial, organisational and time-planning
  skills, the ability to communicate effectively, and knowledge about
  the University and Lithuanian higher education. These data were used
  to create a competency map for VU SR members to help them to improve
  their competencies in a targeted and consistent way.
- Motivating factors for VU SR members. Members identified the biggest
  benefits they gain from being part of the Students\' Union as
  competences, community and meaningful self-expression.

## CO<sub>2</sub> footprint study 

Purpose of the study: this report aims to assess the environmental
impact of the activities of Vilnius University Students\' Representation
(VU SR) by analysing CO₂ emissions and identifying the main sources of
pollution.

What was studied: Activities carried out by VU SR in 2024 related to
transport, waste, energy consumption and printing and the CO₂ emissions
they generate.

The study was carried out between January and December 2024.

Key findings of the report:

- The total CO₂ emissions from the activities of the VU SR in 2024
  amounted to 15.63 t. The largest emissions came from transport and
  waste.
- Cars remained the most used mode of transport, accounting for 7.46 t
  CO₂. Alternatives such as trains were significantly less polluting
  with 68 times less CO₂ per kilometre.
- Food and plastic waste accounted for the largest share of waste,
  generating 571 kg and 1 421 kg of CO₂ respectively.
- Although some activities have been digitised, printing still consumed
  more than 10,000 sheets, generating 68.4 kg CO₂.
- Energy consumption (21 472 kWh) accounted for 5 kg of CO₂ emissions,
  but its control was limited due to its dependence on the
  infrastructure of the VU.
