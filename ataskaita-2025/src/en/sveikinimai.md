Dear students,  

I whole-heartedly gongratulate you on your excellent performance!  

VU SR has been an active, constructive and reliable partner for many years, both in the university community and at national level. Thank you for the meaningful cooperation with the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport - together we are finding the best solutions to the issues of quality of studies, students' welfare and improvement of the higher education system, and we are creating a stronger and more open academic environment.  

I particularly appreciate your ability to mobilise students' voices, to identify their most pressing needs and to actively engage in a dialogue that translates into real change. This is a sign of responsibility, maturity and leadership.  

Let us continue to strengthen cooperation! Best wishes for the future!

Dear Students, Members of the Vilnius University Student Representative Council, 

I sincerely congratulate you on the occasion of the reporting-election conference. 

Vilnius University students are an active, conscious, and change-oriented part of society. Your voice is heard not only at the University but also beyond it - in educational policy, public discussions, and government institutions. This reflects the University's aspiration to be open, creative, and socially responsible: from student assistance initiatives to addressing the challenges of academic ethics in the context of modern technologies. 

I especially appreciate that the Student Representative Council is not limited to formal representation - you consistently care about the quality of studies, defend student rights, strengthen the community, create meaningful initiatives, and foster academic values. Thanks to you, the principles of interdisciplinarity, inclusion, responsibility, and citizenship continue to spread. 

I hope that your meaningful work receives the appreciation it deserves. May the strong student voice and the vibrant spirit of academic self-governance endure, and may such an active and mature student community continue to grow. Good luck in all your activities!

## Vilnius University Library

Dear students, 

Our Library and VUSR have been working together for many years – not only sharing ideas, but also implementing them together, launching meaningful initiatives, and building together a community spirit. 

Your drive and engagement, critical thinking, and kind support are invaluable contributions that help us grow, improve, and create a welcoming place suitable for studying and passing free time. 

We are glad that the Library is the place not only for your work and studies, but also for making friends, where ideas, people, and generations come together. This year in particular we see the importance of listening to each other and looking for solutions together – whether it is related to the enhancement of information literacy, the benefits and challenges posed by artificial intelligence, making the Library's services accessible to all students, or just having a heart-to-heart conversation about what is on your mind, what is currently worrying you the most, what is making you dream big. 

Every initiative you take becomes a part of the history of the University. It is you who are always looking for and finding new ways, creating new traditions, and leaving your mark for the future generations of students. We sincerely wish that you never lose your curiosity, drive, and, above all, faith in your ideas. May VUSR's activities, new experiences, and the people you meet inspire you to move boldly forward both in your studies and in your personal lives. 

The Library is and always will be your home. It is the place where your ideas, questions, stories, or a mere desire to spend time together are always welcome.
