The Revision Commission is the controlling body for financial and performance control of municipal institutions of VU SR, divisions of VU SR and other structural units of VU SR. The Commission consists of five members elected at the VU SA Reporting-Elective Conference.   

During the reporting period, the Revision Commission consisted of: 

- Aušrinė Dichavičiūtė (chairperson) 
- Haroldas Žalūda 
- Martyna Vaitkūnaitė 
- Šarūnas Grigonis 
- Vilija Valiukonytė 

In 2024-2025, the Revision Commission updated the VU SR Performance Assessment Methodology and assessed the Organisation's performance by it. During the reporting period, 1 open meeting of the Audit Commission and 28 closed working sessions were held. In addition, about 250 individual and/or group meetings were held with the audited VU SR structural units. 

During the meetings, the Revision Commission evaluated whether VU SR (U), VU SR Parliament, VU SR Council, VU SR ISF, Consultation Group, students initiatives and other structural units of the Organisation meet the qualitative and quantitative criteria. The information was collected not only during the meetings with the units under review but also during the participation in the meetings of the VU SR Parliament and/or VU SR Council, trainings and various events of the Organisation. 

The Revision Commission was also active in explaining the documents regulating the activities and advising VU SR members on various issues - more than 20 explanations were provided. During the reporting period, the Audit Commission not only shared its insights with the working group responsible for updating the VU SR activities' governing documents but also presented a mid-term activity report at an open meeting of the VU SR Parliament. 

The Revision Commission submits the report on the evaluation of the organisation's activities of the VU SR during the VU SR Reporting-Election Conference (the evaluation report is available at <https://www.vusa.lt/lt/veiklos-ir-tyrimu-ataskaitos>).
