During 2024-2025, the group acted based on the data protection risk assessment of VU SR that was carried out last year. The description of the procedure for personal data processing in VU SR was reviewed and it was decided to make proposals for updates, making it pertinent. An incident management and response plan has also been developed. Activities were presented to the VU SR Council. During the reference period a collection of obligations to protect the confidentiality of personal data was carried out by the members of VU SR, who were appointed as people responsible for the protection of personal data in their units. Aforementioned people were then tested on the topic of personal data protection by using the VMA platform. 

When necessary, VU SR contracts were reviewed and it was proposed to refrain from collecting unnecessary personal data, if these were collected. A register of VU SR surveys that record personal data was created. During the reference period 4 in-person meetings and a remote meeting took place, activities were continuously coordinated in a joint correspondence between members and the President. At the end of the reporting period, the work for the future period was set.
