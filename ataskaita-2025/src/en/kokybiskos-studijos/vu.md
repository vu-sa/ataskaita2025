# Representation in the University's Governance Bodies

## VU Council

Students\' representatives - Klėja Merčaitytė, Justinas Kondratas.

The VU council is the governing body of the University, which oversees
whether the activities and management of the University are in
accordance with the University\'s mission, goals, objectives and
principles, general academic interests, and the requirements of
publicity and accountability to the public set out in the Statutes.

During the reporting period, the newly elected council of Vilnius
University was formed, which this year had the important task of
electing the new Rector of Vilnius University. In parallel, during the
reporting period, the external representative of the students, Justinas
Kondratas, was re-elected by a decision of the VU SR Parliament.

In the previous composition of the council, the council had to approve
the description of the procedure for the election of the rector of VU,
approved for the candidate to present the approve the schedule of
meetings for the presentation of the candidate, and review the
activities of the centre for pedagogy training. The VU Council also had
a meeting in Šiauliai, during which it met with the leaders of the
Šiauliai municipality. During the discussion, the issue of ensuring the
integration of international students in the city was also raised. The
VU Council also presented its opinion to the VU Senate on various
issues, and the VU SR representatives raised the issue of the price
acceptance process for foreign language study programmes.

In December, after the swearing-in of the new VU Council members, the
following key issues were discussed:

- Approval of the VU 2024 activity report;

- Approval of the VU 2025 budget;

- The VU Council\'s expectations for the VU 2026-2030 strategic action
  plan;

- Update of the VU Council\'s Rules of Procedure.

The new team of the VU Council held consultations on the main objectives
for the coming year and expressed expectations on the need for changes
in the different procedures existing at the University.

This year, the tradition of the annual report of the students to the VU
Council was continued, with the VU President sharing insights from the
life of the students at the University, covering the topics of quality
of studies, individualisation, increased focus on resilience to external
threats and involvement of the students in research activities. The
importance of fostering emotional well-being, the integration of
international students, the quality of doctoral studies, and ensuring
that the University\'s infrastructure meets the needs of students were
also addressed.

During the reporting period, student representatives of the VU Council
also participated in two strategic sessions of the VU Senate (you can
read more about them in the next section).

## VU Senate

Students\' representatives (From 7 June 2024 to 20 September 2024) -
Simonas Granskas, Julija Jarutytė, Gabrielė Kasperaitė, Justinas
Kavoliūnas, Justas Lebedevas, Viktorija Milko, Martyna Pikelytė, Lukas
Stakėla, Daniel Šematovič.

Students\' representatives (from 20 September 2024 to the present) -
Simonas Granskas, Ieva Gruodytė, Julija Jarutytė, Gabrielė Kasperaitė,
Justinas Kavoliūnas, Viktorija Milko, Daniel Šematovič, Samanta
Valiušaitytė, Povilas Virbašius.

The VU Senate is the governing body of the University, made up of
members of the VU academic community. The Senate is responsible for
overseeing and improving the quality of studies, promoting culture,
science, research and teaching freedom at the University. The work of
the Senate is divided into 3 main areas of activity. The Study, Research
and Quality and Development committees examine issues relevant to their
areas of activity and submit their conclusions to the VU Senate for
approval.

During the reporting period (from the VU SR AC 2023-2024 to the AC
2024-2025), 11 Senate meetings and 8 electronic votes were held. Student
representatives also participated in two strategic sessions of the VU
Senate, the ceremony of conferring the Honorary Doctorate of Vilnius
University, the ceremonial Senate meeting during which the new members
of the VU Council read out and signed the commitments to Vilnius
University, and the inauguration of the 87th Rector of Vilnius
University, Professor Rimvydas Petrauskas. One of the VU Senate\'s
strategic sessions was devoted to finalising the analysis of the VU\'s
SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), and the May
strategic session discussed how the insights from the SWOT session could
become part of the new VU strategy or the VU Senate\'s work plan for
next year.

Student representatives were actively involved in the following working
groups: the working group on the update of the model regulations of the
core academic unit of Vilnius University, the working group on the
development of a plan for the prevention of academic dishonesty at
Vilnius University, which was established on the initiative of VU SR.
The results of these working groups (updated model regulations of the
core academic units and the academic dishonesty prevention plan) are
expected to be approved by the VU Senate this academic year.

VU SR has also initiated amendments to the regulations of the VU study
programme committees, which are currently under consideration by the VU
Senate study committee and should be approved at the next VU Senate
meeting.

The most important issues for the students discussed at the Senate:

- Approval of the Regulations on the preparation, defence and
  accumulation of written works of Vilnius University Students

Benefits for students: the updated regulations do away with the Unit\'s
written thesis procedure, thus transferring its former competence to the
Unit\'s methodological guidelines for the preparation of written theses,
it is clarified that the thesis topics proposed for students (as well as
the thesis topics proposed by students) must be approved by the study
programme committee, and the thesis defence committee will only be
guided by these regulations in the performance of its functions.

- Approval of the regulations of the Vilnius University Doctoral
  Programme

Benefits for students: A new chapter XII has been added to the
regulation, defining the conduct of interdisciplinary doctoral studies.
This is an important step towards modern and flexible third cycle
studies.

- Approval of the Regulations on Studies at Vilnius University

Benefits for students: the 15 study credits of debt and/or academic debt
rate provided for in the Regulations for the removal of a student from
the University has been increased to a rate of more than 20 study
credits of debt and/or academic debt, in order to ensure proper
management of student attrition from studies at Vilnius University.

- Approval of the guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence at
  Vilnius University

Benefits for students: the guidelines provide guidance on the
appropriate use of AI tools in research, teaching and learning
activities to avoid breaches of academic ethics, breaches of copyright
law and disclosure of personal or confidential information, and discuss
the main tools used in teaching and learning and research activities.

- Changes to the criteria for *Cum Laude* and *Magna Cum Laude* diplomas

Benefits for students: the criteria that meet the highest achievement
requirement for *Magna Cum Laude* candidates have been detailed, the
additional requirement for core units to provide a brief justification
of the quality and significance of the graduate\'s performance has been
added, and the imperative to include the VU endorsement in the research
output has been removed.

- Approval of the rules of procedure for residency studies

Benefits for students: the introduction of competency-based training,
enabling resident doctors to carry out independent clinical activities
during their residency studies. The regulation also introduces the
possibility of suspension of residency training. It also details the
professional practice of the resident in the residency base, describing
the guarantees for resident doctors, including the duration of the work,
the on-call procedure and the interaction with the resident\'s
supervisors and mentors.

- Presentation of the VU SR study on academic dishonesty of VU students
  and establishment of a working group for the development of a plan to
  prevent academic dishonesty at Vilnius University

Benefit for students: the [VU SR study on academic dishonesty of VU
students](https://www.vusa.lt/lt/naujiena/naujas-tyrimas-atskleidzia-akademinio-nesaziningumo-masta-vilniaus-universitete)
was presented at the VU Senate meeting and received positive comments
and observations. The study highlighted the need for the University to
adopt a plan to ensure effective prevention of academic dishonesty. This
plan will enable the University to act more systematically and
strategically in the area of academic dishonesty prevention and will
provide concrete actions to be taken by both the academic stem units and
the various decision-making structures.

- Presentation \"Doctoral studies: problems and possible solutions for
  doctoral students\"

Benefits for students: for the first time at a meeting of the Vilnius
University Senate, a representative of the students gave a presentation
on PhD studies at Vilnius University, alongside a presentation by the
vice-rector on PhD studies at Vilnius University and a presentation by
the Head of the Doctoral and Postdoctoral Unit on the Doctoral Studies
Survey. It highlighted the core issues that VU SR sees from the
interviews with PhD students and the survey coordinated with the DPU:
social relations with the supervisor; integration differences; financial
issues (mainly related to the use of the PhD fund) and employability at
the University. In addition to the activities carried out by the VU SA
to reduce the scope of these problems (training of supervisors and
supervisees of PhD students, mentoring of PhD students, etc.), possible
solutions to the problems were proposed and are described in more detail
in the section on PhD student representation. A decision was also taken
to organise a separate meeting of the VU Senate to discuss doctoral
issues.

- Through the eyes of VU student(s)

As every year, at the Senate, the President of VU SR presented how the
University is seen by students. The presentation welcomed the
development of integration, students\' research activities, the
increasing focus on third cycle studies, internationalisation, etc. The
data from Part I of the freshmen integration survey were also briefly
shared, and the following areas of the University\'s activities were
highlighted for improvement: the quality of internship organisation and
performance, updating the content of studies and teaching methods,
development of interdisciplinarity, increasing the focus on citizenship
and societal resilience, adaptation of studies, services, information
and infrastructure for students with disabilities, upgrading of the
infrastructure of dormitories, etc.

## VU Rectorate

Students\' representative - Klėja Merčaitytė

The Rectorate is a collegial body that advises the Rector of the VU,
discusses the most important issues of the VU, and provides comments and
observations from the perspective of the units. The Rectorate is
composed of the rector, vice-rector, pro-rectors, chancellor, heads of
core units, the president of VU SR and other members appointed by the
rector.

During the reporting period, the results of the survey of PhD students
were presented at the rectorate, the descriptions of the procedures for
the administration of the VU social partnership and lifelong learning
programmes were discussed, and the conditions and procedures for the
recruitment of lecturers were debated. The possibilities of expanding
the recruitment of students at the University were also discussed, as
well as the draft guidelines for the use of affiliation and the draft
plan for the implementation of the VU Sustainable Development Goals. At
the Rector\'s Office, we also had a discussion on the concept and
implementation plan for VU Alumni Relations and on fixed-term contracts
for academic staff over 65 years old. Following the election of the new
Rector, the principles of the Rector\'s Programme and the development of
the new VU Strategy were presented.

The VU SR President was involved in the discussion of issues of concern
to students at the Rectorate, shared VU SR news and presented the
results of the VU SR study on the integration of first-year students for
2024-2025, highlighting the recommendations to ensure the smoothness of
the future integration process.

## Meetings of Vice-Deans for Academic Affairs

Student representative - Povilas Virbašius

The meetings of the Vice-Deans of Academic Affairs provide conclusions
and recommendations for the improvement of the University\'s study
activities. All Deputy Heads of the academic units of the University\'s
academic departments responsible for studies, as well as student
representatives, attend these meetings.

During the reporting period, 9 meetings were held to discuss individual
study choices, internationalisation, prevention of drop-out, admission
of students and trends in these processes. Amendments to the VU Study
Regulations, the description of the procedure for the development,
implementation and improvement of VU study programmes and the procedure
for the crediting of VU study results were also discussed. The
representative of VU SR initiated and presented amendments to the
Regulations of the VU Study Programme Committee, which were discussed at
the meeting. The semester student studies satisfaction and alumni
surveys were also reviewed, and the VU SR Integration Process
Coordinator presented the results of Part I of the VU First-Year Student
Integration Survey. The indicators of the VU Study Quality Manual were
also reviewed. Other issues of importance to students were also
discussed during the meetings.

## Representation in VU Faculty Councils and Study Programme Committees (SPCs)

During the reporting period, students\' interests were represented not
only at the central level but also across all core academic units of
Vilnius University -- student representatives were active in all Faculty
Councils and various Study Programme Committees (SPCs).

Faculty Councils at VU discuss a wide range of issues: they approve the
Faculty's activity plan, budget, scientific research directions, the
members of SPCs and other committees (except student representatives),
consider new study programmes and modifications to existing ones, and
evaluate the outcomes of research and studies. A Faculty Council
consists of the Faculty head, teaching staff, members of the academic
and non-academic community, social partners, and student
representatives.

Study Programme Committees (SPCs) are academic bodies responsible for
coordinating and overseeing study programmes. SPCs ensure the
consistency of programme objectives, intended competencies, content,
teaching methods, and student achievement assessments. They also improve
study programmes based on feedback from students, lecturers, alumni, and
social partners, along with other quality indicators. Each SPC includes
at least three lecturers, one social partner, and one student
representative.

To ensure expert-level student representation, various initiatives were
implemented throughout the year: central and faculty-level training
sessions on advocacy were organized, efforts were made to promote
student representation activities within faculties, and the event
*\"Representation First-Hand\"* was held to introduce students to
representation opportunities. Student representatives also completed a
dedicated knowledge test to reinforce their understanding of academic
structure and governance. Additionally, they collected student opinions
(through surveys and focus groups), which were systematized and
presented during SPC meetings. Faculty representative coordinators
reviewed over 1,100 individual course descriptions, identifying
problematic areas to be addressed.

This year, over 250 SPC meetings and more than 100 Faculty Council
meetings took place at VU. Below is a detailed statistical summary of
these meetings and the main issues discussed.

guidelines for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at
Vilnius University and a draft action plan. The document was discussed
during a meeting of the VU Council.

The plan outlines a systematic approach for the University to ensure
sustainable development in areas such as community growth,
infrastructure adaptation, decision-making, and the optimization of
study processes. This year, a solid foundation was finally laid, and the
document is now awaiting approval.

### Work group on the development of the pedagogical competences system for VU lecturers 

Student representative - Povilas Virbašius

The Learning and Teaching Thematic Peer Group, initiated by the European
University Association, brings together a group of selected EUA member
universities on an annual basis to discuss and analyse practices and
lessons learned in the organisation and implementation of learning and
teaching at institutional level. They also identify examples of good
practice on a given topic. This year, Vilnius University and
representatives of its administration and students are taking part in a
working group to analyse examples and make recommendations for the
quality and impact of staff development in the field of training. This
group is looking at how data, including institutional research, feedback
from colleagues and students, can be used to assess the impact of
different forms of staff development and how staff development impacts
on the institutional teaching culture. The group will identify key
indicators to measure how staff development activities improve student
learning outcomes. It will also suggest ways to strengthen and make good
use of them.

## Representation of PhD students

During the reporting period, active work on the representation of third
cycle students continued. During this period, three meetings were held
with the VU SR PhD Students\' Working Group, with whom we discussed
important issues: the situation of employability of doctoral students at
VU, the need to improve the integration of doctoral students, the
indexation of scholarships, the coordination of the annual survey of PhD
students, etc. Also at the beginning of the term (and during the course
of the term), three main areas emerged on which we have been working
this year: improving the relationship with the supervisor, improving the
integration process, and the issue of the use of the finances and the
employability of PhD students. Below are the main aspects and the work
carried out in these areas.

Improving relations with the supervisor. Last year, we indicated that
there is a lack of trainings at the VU that is targeted at supervisors
of PhD students. This year we organised two such trainings, the first of
which focused on improving the competences of supervisors who have a
first PhD student, and the second on interdisciplinarity in the PhD. The
first training was attended by almost 40 participants and the second by
11 supervisors and managers. Both trainings were well received and we
plan to organise them again in the next academic year on other relevant
topics.

Improving the integration process. It is clear that the integration of
students at Level III is still lame compared to Levels I and II and
needs to be improved. Therefore, at the beginning of the academic year,
during the meeting of the Vice-Deans of Science, we expressed the need
and recommendations on how the core academic units could better
integrate newly enrolled PhD students into the study process. We also
contributed to the organisation of a central integration day for PhD
students (you can read more about this in the section \"III cycle
integration\"). The Doctoral Student Mentoring Initiative will be
launched next academic year with the aim of creating a continuous
mentoring relationship between older PhD students or young PhD students
and younger PhD students (including first year PhD students), providing
them with academic, administrative and social support. We are also
planning an interdisciplinary PhD symposium in July, where PhD students
will have the opportunity not only to make new contacts but also to
learn about the latest trends in interdisciplinary research.

The issue of the use of funding and employability of PhD students. It is
evident both from the interviews with the members of the VU SR PhD
Student Working Group and from the results of this year\'s survey of
doctoral students that the use of finances (the PhD fund) and
employability at the University are still quite important topics that
require attention. The vast majority of PhD students do not use the PhD
fund fully or at all, and some PhD students do not even know what the
PhD fund is. These circumstances also contribute to the rather poor
mobility rates of doctoral students. There are also problems in the
employability of third cycle students: there are untaxed extra and
non-doctoral activities, and some students want to work at the
university, but the VU does not provide the conditions for this.
Therefore, both at the February Senate meeting and at the March meeting
of the Vice-Deans of Science, these issues were presented and
appropriate proposals were made: to inform PhD students in detail about
the study fund, its size and possibilities of its use, to encourage PhD
students to use the funds and to exploit the possibilities of employing
PhD students in project activities.

It is worth noting that this year, for the first time, a representative
of the students presented the above-mentioned problems and possible
solutions at the Senate meeting: in addition to the above-mentioned
proposals on the use of funds and employability, the need for a more
coherent, more complete integration of PhD students in the units and for
supervisors to be more actively involved in targeted training were
highlighted. The increasing focus on PhD studies is certainly
encouraging and we believe that it is crucial for building a more
cohesive, coherent and inclusive academic community.
