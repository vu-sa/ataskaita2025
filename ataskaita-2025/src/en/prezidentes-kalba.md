Dear students, members of the Organization and Vilnius University Community 

35th year of the Students’ Representation has been full of change. The main directions and efforts of this year were focused on individual studies, the creation and strengthening of student initiatives, the inclusion of students with disabilities, and resilience against external threats. 

We actively contributed to the formation of the new Government’s program and implementation plan, provided proposals, and participated in various working groups on matters important to students. 

We closely collaborate with higher education institutions on topics such as student involvement in research activities, the prevention of academic ethics violations, and the development of the social dimension in higher education. We engaged in dialogue within the international ARQUS alliance and shared best practices with student unions abroad. We worked on updates to the Organization’s documents, Style Guide, Integration, and Planning processes, established a Students’ Initiative Center, and consistently worked on developing the competencies of our Organization members. 

I can confidently say that VU SR is strong, visible, and heard. 

We will enter the upcoming academic year with newly approved strategic projects that impact every member of our community. I am proud of the Organization, our collective engagement, and our strong partnerships. 

I invite you to explore all the work done throughout the year in the VU SR 2024–2025 report. Sincere thanks to you for this year—let’s continue working “United for the future of students!” 

**Klėja Merčaitytė**
